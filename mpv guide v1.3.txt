[Tips]

1. Create a local playlist of all files matching an extension within a directory in terminal
	* note: the included playlist manager plugin does this automatically

	1a. Open terminal (Windows key + R, "cmd")
	1b. Navigate to folder containing video files (cd C:/path/to/folder or, if on another drive, X: & cd X:/path/to/folder)
	1c. List all file paths, one per line, to a text file and save as .m3u
	
		dir *.mp3 /b /s | sort > %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\playlist.m3u
	
				1d. Set .m3u file extension to open with mpv by right-clicking playlist.m3u -> properties 
				  -> change opens with -> more options -> look for another app on this PC
				   -> type "%USERPROFILE%" in explorer address bar -> select mpv.exe
		
				1e. Now just double click any .m3u file to open a playlist in mpv
		
2. Save URLs to .m3u file for quick YouTube/web playlists -- https://i.imgur.com/p0tTEwE.gifv
	2a. Download a browser extension for selecting links then saving to txt file or 

		* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-klipper-extract-all/fahollcgofmpnehocdgofnhkkchiekoo?hl=en
        * Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-gopher/
			* The functionality of this addon isn't the same as Link Klipper in that it can't select links via marquee tool but 
			  it's still a decent tool for extracting video urls
	2a. Right-click+drag over the titles/hyperlinks of videos you want in your playlist
		* If you need to create multiple .txt files you can join them into one with the following command in terminal
		
			copy E:\path\to\downloads\files\*.txt %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\playlist.m3u
			
	3a. Double-click on playlist.m3u to open playlist
	
[Notes]

* This installation requires manually updating youtube-dl.exe/mpv.exe/ffmpeg.exe from time to time
