3. Install aria2c.exe https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases
	* aria2-1.32.0-win-64bit-build1.zip
	
	3a. Extract aria2c.exe from the archive
	3b. Place in C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\TISTORY\PortableGit\mingw64\bin
		*not in C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\TISTORY\PortableGit\bin (this folder only has 3 files)
		
	3c.(optional) Place into your %PATH% (Windows key + R, "%PATH%")

# Usage

1. Get all tistory pages/urls with python

	1a. Open terminal (Windows key + R, "cmd")
	1b. Navigate to the directory you downloaded the scripts to (type cd "C:\path\to\TISTORY\Ripper\")
		* drag+drop the folder onto terminal to print the file path
		
			On C:/ drive:

			cd C:\Users\%USERNAME%\desktop\TISTORY\Ripper\

			On storage drive where X = drive letter:
	
			X: & cd X:\path\to\TISTORY\Ripper
		
	1c. Run RIP.py

		python RIP.py

		* if python isn't recognized, specify it's path manually:
		
		If python3 it should be
		
		"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\python.exe" RIP.py

		If python 2.7 it should be
		
		"C:\Python27\python.exe" RIP.py
		
			** if that doesn't work type the following in terminal to find your .exe path:
				
1.				py -3 [or py -2]
2.				import os
3.				sys.executable

   + This will create folders for each page on tistory and then a list containing all /image/ links on that page
		* To get the full resolution pictures, all links need to be changed to /original/ (step 4)

4. Change all /image/ links to /original/

	2a. Open terminal (Windows key + R, "cmd")
	2b. Replace text with find and replace (fnr.exe)
		
	    "C:\path\to\TISTORY\Ripper\aria2c+fnr\fnr.exe" --cl --dir "C:\path\to\TISTORY\Ripper\download" --fileMask "*.txt" --includeSubDirectories --find "image" --replace "original"
		
			- Confirm text has been replaced by opening images.txt
			
5. Drag+drop Ripper folder to a drive/directory with enough space for several GB of pictures (X:\path\to\downloads\Ripper)

6. Download Tistory pictures

	4a. Open C:\path\to\PortableGit\git-bash.exe 
	
	4b. Navigate to download script directory
	
		cd X:\path\to\downloads\Ripper
		
	4c. Run get_links.bash
		
		"X:\path\to\downloads\Ripper\get_links.bash"
		
	+ This will loop through each folder in X:\path\to\downloads\Ripper\downloads and download each image link via aria2c
	+ Per defualt settings aria2c will download 5 images simultaneously but you can change this by editing get_links.bash, just change 5 to your desired value
		* Options located here: https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html
	
	4d. Wait for downloads to finish then close git-bash window
	
# Cleanup	

1. Delete all the images.txt files left over

	1a. Open terminal (Windows key + R, "cmd")
	1b. Delete all files with desired extension (in this case .txt)
	
		del "X:\path\to\downloads\Ripper\download\*.txt" /s
		
2. Move all folders/pictures out of X:\path\to\downloads\Ripper\downloads\
3. Move X:\path\to\downloads\Ripper folder back to C:\path\to\TISTORY\Ripper\
4. You should now have a fresh C:\path\to\TISTORY\ directory
